# Update History
## 
 Ver 1.0 - Working version for first upload
 Ver 1.1 - updating to match minor revision
 Ver 1.5 - updated timer and includes boxing bell sound
 Ver 1.7 - implemented water intake animation and small bug fixes
 Ver 1.10 - Reworked activity timer GUI (XML) and added new functionality.
          - You can now set 2 timers. One for work and the other for rest.
          - Minor changed include setting textSize from "dp" to "sp"
 Ver 1.11 - Changes to TimerActivity.java
          - Minor bug improvements 
          - New update allows the User to reset timer to pre-historic value. Previously when reset
          button was clicked, the seekbar would initialise back to it's own state. This meant waisting
          time on reconfiguring desired workout and rest times.
